# BERTopic_nouns_cooccurrence
We provide code for a modified version of BERTopic using information about co-occurrence between nouns. <br>
Using a co-occurrence matrix of nouns, we employed a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method to extract embedding vectors of each document representing topics, which can be reflected with nouns.
